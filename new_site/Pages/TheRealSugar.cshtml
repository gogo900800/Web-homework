            Sugar isn’t just sweet — it’s strategic. It’s the most successful distraction in human history, quietly folded into every birthday party, every breakfast cereal, every "treat" given to a child before
            they can even speak.
        </p>
        <p>
            But what if it wasn’t a treat? What if it was a tranquilizer?

            For decades, we've been told that sugar is a reward, a comfort, a symbol of joy. But behind the frosting and sprinkles lies something darker. Sugar is engineered dependency — 
            a subtle sedative handed to the masses with a smile.
        </p>
        <p>
            The government doesn’t need chains when the people are already bound by their own desire for another bite. Sugar is the leash — and we’re trained to love the feeling of it tightening.

            This isn’t dessert. It’s a design. And the truth? The truth is bitter.
