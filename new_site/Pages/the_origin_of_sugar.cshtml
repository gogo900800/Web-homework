                Sugar doesn’t start in a factory. It starts in the earth.

                Long before it hides inside candy wrappers and soda bottles, sugar begins its life in tall, green stalks — sugarcane — or in the pale, humble sugar beet.
                These plants are harvested, crushed, boiled, filtered, and crystallized until all that’s left is the sweet, white powder we know so well.

                But it wasn’t always this easy.

                Centuries ago, sugar was so rare and valuable that it was called "white gold." It fueled trade empires, powered plantations, and even helped shape the modern world — not
                just through taste, but through labor, exploitation, and wealth.

                So when you ask where sugar comes from, you’re not just asking about a plant.

                You’re asking about history. Industry. Power.

                And it all starts in a field...
                with something that looks innocent.
